# PyCricket

A simple logic gate based programming language, with the ability to declare class-like structures to add more power to the language. ccricket is the compiler, which will produce a bytecode file. Then, this file can be run in Cricket's specialised execution engine, which is run via the crickets (Cricket Shell) program.

# Sample Usage:

Compilation: (Assuming an input file of prog.ckt and an output bytecode file of prog)

`ccricket prog.ckt prog`

Execution:

`crickets prog`
